# CNPG PostgreSQL Extensions Container Images

This repository provides **maintenance scripts** for building **immutable
container images** containing PostgreSQL extensions supported by
[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/). These images are designed to
integrate seamlessly with the image volume extensions feature in CloudNativePG.

## Documentation

- [Adding a New Extension](./CONTRIBUTING_NEW_EXTENSION.md): A step-by-step
  guide for contributors.
- [Building Locally](./BUILD.md): Technical instructions for the build system
  (Dagger/Task).
- [CloudNativePG Documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/imagevolume_extensions/):
  How to use these images in your cluster.

---

## Requirements

- **CloudNativePG** ≥ 1.27
- **PostgreSQL** ≥ 18 (requires the `extension_control_path` feature)
- **Kubernetes** 1.33+ (with [ImageVolume feature enabled in 1.33 and 1.34](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/16/kubernetes-1-31-image-volume-source/))

---

## Supported Extensions

CloudNativePG actively maintains the following third-party extensions, provided
they are maintained by their respective authors, and PostgreSQL Debian Group
(PGDG) packages are available.

| Extension | Description | Project URL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[pgAudit](pgaudit)** | PostgreSQL audit extension | [github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit) |
| **[pg_crash](pg-crash)** | **Disruptive** fault injection and chaos engineering extension | [github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pg_crash](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pg_crash) |
| **[pgvector](pgvector)** | Vector similarity search for PostgreSQL | [github.com/pgvector/pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) |
| **[PostGIS](postgis)** | Geospatial database extension for PostgreSQL | [postgis.net/](https://postgis.net/) |
| **[TimescaleDB Toolkit](timescaledb-toolkit)** | Extension for more TimescaleDB hyperfunctions | [https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit/](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit/) |


Extensions are provided only for the OS versions already built by the
[`cloudnative-pg/postgres-containers`](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-containers) project,
specifically Debian `stable` and `oldstable`.

---

## Contribution and Maintenance Policy

Contributors are welcome to propose and maintain additional extensions.

### Governance and Compliance

The project adheres to the following frameworks:

- **Governance Model:** complies with the CloudNativePG (CNPG) Governance
  Model, as defined in [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md).
- **Code of Conduct:** follows the CNCF Code of Conduct, as defined in
  [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Extension Requirements

When proposing a new extension, the following criteria must be met:

- **Licensing and IP ownership:** We redistribute unmodified third-party
  software as container images. We prioritize licenses explicitly allowed by the
  [CNCF License Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/policies-guidance/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md),
  which includes the PostgreSQL License (relevant to this project). Other
  open-source licenses, such as FSF-approved licenses (e.g., GNU GPL), will be
  considered on a case-by-case basis to ensure compliance with redistribution
  requirements.
- **Structure:** only one extension can be included within an extension folder.
- **Debian Packages:** Extension images must be built using a Debian package
  provided by a trusted source like the
  [PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG)](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt).
  This ensures compatibility with the base images and standard package
  management procedures.
- **License inclusion:** all necessary license agreements for the extension and
  its dependencies must be included within the extension folder (refer to the
  examples in the `pgvector` and `postgis` folders).

### Submission Process

1. **Request and commitment:** Open a new issue requesting the extension.
   The contributor(s) must agree to become "component owners" and maintainers
   for that extension.
2. **Approval:** Once approved by maintainers, the component owner(s) will be
   added to the `CODEOWNERS` file for the specific folder.
3. **Submission:** Component owner(s) open a Pull Request (PR) to introduce the
   new extension. The PR is reviewed, approved, and merged.
4. **Naming:** The name of the extension is the registry name.

### Removal Policy

If component owners decide to stop maintaining their extension, and no other
contributors are found, the main project maintainers reserve the right to
**unconditionally remove that extension**.

---

## Naming & Tagging Convention

Each extension image tag follows this format:

```
<extension-name>:<ext_version>-<timestamp>-<pg_version>-<distro>
```

**Example:**
Building `pgvector` version `0.8.1` on PostgreSQL `18.0` for the `trixie`
distro, with build timestamp `202509101200`, results in:

```
pgvector:0.8.1-202509101200-18-trixie
```

For convenience, **rolling tags** should also be published:

```
pgvector:0.8.1-18-trixie
pgvector:0.8.1-18-trixie
```

This scheme ensures:

- Alignment with the upstream `postgres-containers` base images
- Explicit PostgreSQL and extension versioning
- Multi-distro support

---

## Image Labels

Each extension image includes OCI-compliant labels for runtime inspection
and tooling integration. These metadata fields enable CloudNativePG and
other tools to identify the base PostgreSQL version and OS distribution.

### CloudNativePG-Specific Labels

| Label                                 | Description                      | Example                                                 |
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| `io.cloudnativepg.image.base.name`    | Base PostgreSQL container image  | `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-bookworm` |
| `io.cloudnativepg.image.base.pgmajor` | PostgreSQL major version         | `18`                                                    |
| `io.cloudnativepg.image.base.os`      | Operating system distribution    | `bookworm`                                              |
| `io.cloudnativepg.image.sql.version`  | PostgreSQL extension SQL version | `0.8.2`                                                 |

### Standard OCI Labels

In addition to CloudNativePG-specific labels, all images include standard OCI
annotations as defined by the [OCI Image Format Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md):

| Label                                  | Description                 |
|:---------------------------------------|:----------------------------|
| `org.opencontainers.image.created`     | Image creation timestamp    |
| `org.opencontainers.image.version`     | Extension's package version |
| `org.opencontainers.image.revision`    | Git commit SHA              |
| `org.opencontainers.image.title`       | Human-readable image title  |
| `org.opencontainers.image.description` | Image description           |
| `org.opencontainers.image.source`      | Source repository URL       |
| `org.opencontainers.image.licenses`    | License identifier          |

You can inspect these labels using container tools:

```bash
# Using docker buildx imagetools
docker buildx imagetools inspect <image> --raw | jq '.annotations'

# Using skopeo
skopeo inspect docker://<image> | jq '.Labels'
```

## Image catalogs

To simplify the deployment of PostgreSQL extensions, this project automatically
generates `ClusterImageCatalog` resources. These catalogs provide a curated
list of compatible extension images for PostgreSQL 18+ versions.

- **Frequency:** Built once a week.
- **Location:** Published in the [`artifacts`
  project](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/artifacts/tree/main/image-catalogs-extensions).
- **Naming Convention:** These are based on the `minimal` catalog and use the
  `catalog-minimal` prefix (e.g., `catalog-minimal-trixie.yaml`).
